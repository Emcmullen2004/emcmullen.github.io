    <h1>HTML Components: Part 1</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>First we did a recap on <a href="htmlbasics.html">HTML Basics</a></p>

    <p>Next we learned about images. The image tag places images into your website. It is written as:<br/>
    &lt;img  src="<i>write link here</i>" alt="<i>write alternative text here</i>"&gt;<br/>
    The image tag is the first self closing tag we learned about, self closing means that you dont need to add a copy of that tag with a "/" in it.<br/>
     Also instead of a link you can use the file name saved on your computer.</p>


    <p>Next we learned about inline and block elements, and their differences. Block elements start and end with a line break. some examples are headings and paragraphs.<br/>
       Inline elements are all others, aka. elements that dont start or end with a line break. some examples are images and links. They only take up as much space as they need to.<br/>
       To add a line break manually you just type &lt;br/&gt;, this is another example of a self closing tag.</p>


    <p>Now we have developer tools. It's a way to access the code from other webites in real time. To use them you use the "fn" key and press "f12", or press "control+shift+i".<br/>
       You can also use the three dots at the top right and then click developer tools in the drop-down window.<br/>
       If you use the selector tool you can go over the elements in the webpage, when you click them you get shown where it is in the dev. tools menu.</p>
