    <h1>HTML Basics</h1> 
    <br/>
    <p>The first think we learned about was the "p" tag, it is used to write text in your website, to use it you type:<br/> &lt;p&gt;<i>write your text here</i> &lt;/p&gt; in your body tag.</p>
    <br/>
     <p>Next we learned about how to add links which was the "a" tag. To use it you type:<br/>&lt;a href="<i>paste your link here</i>"&gt;<i>type the text that shows as the link here</i>&lt;/a&gt;. This goes in your body tag as well.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The last thing we learned was headings which is represented by the "h" tag. headings consist of 1 - 6, the lower the number the bigger the text. To use it you type:<br/>&lt;h<i>1, 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 or 6</i>&gt;<i>Type your heading here</i>&lt;/h<i>1, 2, 3, 4, ,5 or 6</i>&gt;</p>
